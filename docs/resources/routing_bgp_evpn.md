## Schema

### Required

- `instance` (String) BGP instance this EVPN is assigned to.
- `name` (String) Name of the entry.

### Optional

- `comment` (String)
- `disabled` (Boolean)
- `export` (Block List, Max: 1) A group of parameters associated with the route export. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--export))
- `import` (Block List, Max: 1) A group of parameters associated with the route import. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--import))
- `rd` (String) Specifies the value that gets attached to route so that receiving routers can distinguish advertisements that may otherwise look the same. Used to distinguish between tenants using overlapping IP ranges. Also can be used to simplify convergence and redundancy within Virtual Network. RDs form MLAG pairs should be unique, too.
- `vni` (Number) Range of Virtual Network Identifiers.
- `vrf` (String) VRF name.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

<a id="nestedblock--export"></a>
### Nested Schema for `export`

Optional:

- `route_targets` (Set of String) List of route targets that will be added to EVPN routes when exporting.


<a id="nestedblock--import"></a>
### Nested Schema for `import`

Optional:

- `route_targets` (Set of String) List of route targets that will be used to import EVPN routes.

## Import
Import is supported using the following syntax:
```shell
#The ID can be found via API or the terminal
#The command for the terminal is -> :put [/routing/bgp/evpn get [print show-ids]]
terraform import routeros_routing_bgp_evpn.test *3
#Or you can import a resource using one of its attributes
terraform import routeros_routing_bgp_evpn.test "name=xxx"
```
