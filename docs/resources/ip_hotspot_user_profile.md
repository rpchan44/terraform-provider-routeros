User is logged out, dropped of the host list, the address used by the user is freed, when timeout is reached.
- `incoming_filter` (String) Name of the firewall chain applied to incoming packets from the users of this profile, jump rule is required from built-in chain (input, forward, output) to chain=hotspot.
- `incoming_packet_mark` (String) Packet mark put on incoming packets from every user of this profile.
- `insert_queue_before` (String)
- `keepalive_timeout` (String) Keepalive timeout for authorized HotSpot clients. Used to detect, that the computer of the client is alive and reachable. User is logged out, when timeout value is reached.
- `mac_cookie_timeout` (String) Selects mac-cookie timeout from last login or logout. Read more>>.
- `on_login` (String) Script name to be executed, when user logs in to the HotSpot from the particular profile. It is possible to get username from internal user and interface variable.

List of available variables: $user $username (alternative var name for $user) $address $``mac-address`` $interface $cause Starting with v6.34rc11 some additional variables are available: $uptime-secs - final session time in seconds $bytes-in - bytes uploaded $bytes-out - bytes downloaded $bytes-total - bytes up + bytes down $packets-in - packets uploaded $packets-out - packets downloaded $packets-total - packets up + packets down.
- `open_status_page` (String) Option to show status page for user authenticated with mac login method.

For example, to set 1M download, 512k upload for the client, rate-limit=512k/1M.
- `session_timeout` (String) Allowed session time for client. After this time, the user is logged out unconditionally.
